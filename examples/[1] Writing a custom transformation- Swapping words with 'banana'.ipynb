    "# The TextAttacküêô ecosystem: search, transformations, and constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "An attack in TextAttack consists of three basic parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search method\n",
    "The **search method** which explores the space of potential transformations and tries to locate a successful attack. Greedy search, beam search, and brute-force search are all examples of search methods. Since the search method is the backbone of the attack, the term \"search\" is often substituted with \"attack method\" or just \"attack\". In TextAttack, all three of those terms (search, attack, attack method) mean the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformation\n",
    "A **transformation** takes a text input and transforms it, replacing words or phrases with similar ones, while trying not to change the meaning. Paraphrase and synonym substitution are two broad classes of transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "Finally, **constraints** determine whether or not a given transformation is valid. Transformations don't perfectly preserve syntax or semantics, so additional constraints can increase the probability that these qualities are preserved from the source to adversarial example. There are many types of constraints: overlap constraints that measure edit distance, syntactical  constraints check part-of-speech and grammar errors, and semantic constraints like language models and sentence encoders."

    "# A custom transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson explains how to create a custom transformation. In TextAttack, many transformations involve *word swaps*: they take a word and try and find suitable substitutes. Some attacks focus on replacing characters with neighboring characters induce \"typos\". (These don't intend to preserve the grammaticality of inputs.) Other attacks rely on semantics: they take a word and try to replace it with semantic equivalents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Banana word swap üçå\n",
    "\n",
    "As an introduction to writing transformations for TextAttack, we're going to try a very simple transformation: one that replaces any given word with the word 'banana'. In TextAttack, there's an abstract `WordSwap` class that handles the heavy lifting of breaking sentences into words and avoiding replacement of stopwords. We can extend `WordSwap` and implement a single method, `_get_replacement_words`, to indicate to replace each word with 'banana'."

And to use the attack, we need a **goal function**, a **model** and a **dataset**. (The goal function indicates the task our model performs ‚Äì in this case, classification ‚Äì¬†and the type of attack ‚Äì in this case, we'll perform an untargeted attack.)\n",

For the model, let's use an LSTM trained for news classification on the AG News dataset. Luckily, TextAttack comes with 1000 text samples from some popular datasets, as well as pretrained models for those datasets. So we don't have to train our own model, or procure someone else's. We can just use the built-in datasets and models for this."
